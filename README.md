# :postbox: FAQ

  ### 🙋‍ What is XPerion?

  XPerion is an application that helps the community to watch and report problems within government projects. It was founded for Hackribeirão's Hackathon 2019, to fight corruption, in which we won second place.

  Realizing the time and problems found in overpriced buildings in our country (Brazil) and how little knowledgeable the population was, we decided to give the community some powers!

  The platform itself is not yet fully automated. The process of registering projects and faults is still manual.

  ### 👨‍🔬 What are the technologies used?

  Here are some of them:

  #### 📱 Mobile

  React-native, react-navigation, styled-components, moment.js and react-native-maps

  #### 👨‍💻 Server

  Strapi, Amazon S3 and MongoDB

  ### 📲 Can i download it?

  Yes, of course! But there is a catch. It is still not fully functional, and it works only in Ribeirão Preto/SP (Brazil)

  If you still want to try, you can find it on the Play Store 🎉
