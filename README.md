## 🙋‍ What is XPerion?

XPerion is an application that helps the community to watch and report problems within government projects. It was founded for Hackribeirão's Hackathon 2019, to fight corruption, in which we won second place.

Realizing the time and problems found in overpriced buildings in our country (Brazil) and how little knowledgeable the population was, we decided to give the community some powers!

The platform itself is not yet fully automated. The process of registering projects and faults is still manual.
